            <h3>General Housing Hunting Tips </h3>
            <p> 
            Most apartments in Boston are listed by real estate agencies, so you will most likely end up working with a real estate agent to find a place.<br> A full real estate "finder's fee" is usually one month's rent, although some apartment listings will offer a reduced or waived fee, depending on the agreement with the landord.<br> It is possible to find independent apartment listings that are shown and rented directly by the landord, but this is fairly uncommon in the Boston area.
            Be prepared to act quickly (submit an application and deposit) once you have found the housing you want. <br>
            Plan for significant up-front expenses to secure your lease--up to four months' rent for realtor fees, security deposit, first and/or last month's rent etc.
            If possible, pay by check or money order so you can keep a record.<br>
            Before you sign a lease, make sure you read it thoroughly! If you have any questions, ask your realtor or landlord. <br>
